[[Active Directory]] defined user groups to assign access rights to files or other resources to entire groups instead of single [[Users]]. You can add existing [[Users]] and they will automatically inherit the group's privileges. 

They can include [[Users]], [[Computers]], and other [[Groups]].

Groups can be categorized in the following:

- [[Security Groups]]
- [[Organizational Unit]]
