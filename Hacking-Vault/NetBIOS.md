[[NetBIOS]] (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a network service that enables applications on different computers to communicate with each other across a local area network (LAN). 

Currently, [[NetBIOS]] is mostly relegated to specific legacy application use cases that still rely on the suite of communication services.

[[NetBIOS]] is not a network protocol, it operates at Layer 5 of [[OSI Model]]



# 🖊️ Communication

NetBIOS was originally created to standardize and free applications from having to understand the details of the network, including error recovery in session mode. 

A NetBIOS request is provided in the form of a network control block, or NCB, which, among other things, specifies a message location and the name of a destination.

It uses [[NetBios Name Service (NBNS)]] to allow applications to do name resolution and let them communicate with their machine destination.
