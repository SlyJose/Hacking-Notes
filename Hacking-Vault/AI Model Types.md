Let's see how models can be used for different offensive operations.

|Model Type|Purpose|Key Applications in Offensive Security|
|---|---|---|
|**LLMs (Large Language Models)**|Understand and generate natural language and code|Phishing, recon automation, payload generation|
|**Code Generation Models**|Specialized in producing valid code snippets from prompts|Malware writing, vulnerability chaining, obfuscation|
|**Embeddings Models**|Convert text/code into vector form for similarity comparison|OSINT, credential reuse detection, phishing detection evasion|
|**Classification Models**|Assign input to a category (binary/multi-label)|Bypass of email filters, AV/EDR evasion, malicious intent detection|
|**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**|Learn actions based on rewards in an environment|Evasion techniques, polymorphic malware, adaptive C2 behavior|
|**Diffusion & GANs**|Generate media (images, audio, video) using noise-based or adversarial training|Deepfake generation, synthetic voice, QR-based phishing|

#### 🚀 - LLM's
---
**Examples**: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, Zephyr

**Use Cases**:

- Social engineering: impersonation, prompt injection testing
- Recon: parsing breach dumps, enriching OSINT
- Vulnerability exploitation: chaining vulnerabilities based on system output

**Example Prompt**:

> _“Based on this `nmap` scan and `whoami`, suggest next 3 privilege escalation techniques.”_

---
#### 📦 - Code Generation Models
--- 
**Examples**: Codex, Code LLaMA, StarCoder, Replit Code Model

**Use Cases**:

- Reverse shell and stager generation
- Shellcode encoders and loaders
- Exploit script automation

**Example Prompt**:

> _“Write a C++ executable that downloads and executes a file from the web, hides its window, and auto-runs on reboot.”_

---
#### 🖊️ - Embeddings Models and Vector Search
---
**Examples**: BERT, E5, OpenAI Embeddings, FAISS, ChromaDB

**Use Cases**:

- OSINT matching (e.g., developer styles, leaked credential matches)
- Recon based on fuzzy matching (e.g., similar usernames or project names)
- Credential misuse detection in phishing simulations

**Technique**: Use cosine similarity to match a leaked email/password combination with internal access tokens across multiple repositories.

#### 🚀 - Classification Models

**Examples**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Transformer classifiers

**Use Cases**:

- Malware classification (mimicking EDRs to evade)
- Phishing detector bypass simulation
- Malicious/benign script classifiers

**Adversarial Usage**:

- Generate input samples that force misclassification
- Evaluate robustness of detection pipelines

#### 📦 - Reinforcement Learning Models RL

**Examples**: PPO, DQN, A3C with environments like Gym, Unity ML

**Use Cases**:

- Train malware agents to evade detection over time
- Adaptive C2 behavior depending on sandbox/real machine
- Lateral movement with rewards for successful pivots

**Concept**:  
Train agents where actions = commands and rewards = persistence or data exfil success.

#### 🖊️ - Diffusion Models and GANs

**Examples**: Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN, Whisper, Bark, ElevenLabs (voice)

**Use Cases**:

- Clone victim’s voice or video for phishing
- Generate synthetic training data for red team agents
- HTML Smuggling with image-based triggers

**Example Scenario**:  
A threat actor generates a fake LinkedIn profile picture and voice message for deepfake-based CEO fraud using ElevenLabs + Midjourney.
