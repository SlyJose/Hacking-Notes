The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol allows clients (like workstations) to communicate with a server (like a file share). In networks that use Microsoft [[Active Directory]], SMB governs everything from inter-network file-sharing to remote administration. Even the "out of paper" alert your computer receives when you try to print a document is the work of the [[SMB]] protocol.
