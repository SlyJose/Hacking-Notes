TGS are tickets that allow connection to a service. They only allow access to the specific service they were created for. 



# 🖊️ Components

To request a TGS, in the [[Kerberos]] authentication process, the user will send their username and a timestamp encrypted using the Session Key, along with the [[Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)]] and a [[Service Principal Name (SPN)]], which indicates the service and server name we intend to access.
