A [[Trust Relationship]] between domains allows you to authorize a user from domain A to access resources from domain B.

# 📔 Types of trust relationships

- One-way trust relationship: In a one-way trust, if Domain AAA trusts Domain BBB, this means that a user on BBB can be authorized to access resources on AAA.
- Two-way trust relationships: Allow both domains to mutually authorise users from the other. By default, joining several domains under a tree or a forest will form a two-way trust relationship.

It is important to note that having a trust relationship between domains doesn't automatically grant access to all resources on other domains. Once a trust relationship is established, you have the chance to authorize users across different domains, but it's up to you what is actually authorized or not.
