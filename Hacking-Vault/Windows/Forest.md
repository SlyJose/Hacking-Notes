The [[Windows Domain]]s you manage can also be configured in different namespaces. The union of several [[Tree]]s with different namespaces into the same network is known as a forest.

For example:

![[Forest.png]]

Suppose your company THM continues growing and eventually acquires another company called MHT Inc. When both companies merge, you will probably have different domain [[Tree]]s for each company, each managed by its own IT department. 

In order to allow access from users in a [[Tree]] into another one, Domain Admins use [[Trust Relationship]]s.
