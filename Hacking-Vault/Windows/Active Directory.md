# 📦Active Directory Authentication

Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:

- [[Kerberos]]: Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.
- [[NetNTLM]]: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.

A company can also implement a public key infrastructure to use certificates and signatures across the board, to authenticate and secure the components.
This infrastructure is called [[Active Directory Certificate Services]].
