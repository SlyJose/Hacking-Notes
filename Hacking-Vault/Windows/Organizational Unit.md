In [[Active Directory]], [[Organizational Unit]]s are containers of [[Users]] , [[Computers]] and other [[Organizational Unit]]s. 

[[Organizational Unit]]s are handy to apply ==policies== to the [[Users]] and [[Computers]] via [[Group Policy Objects]]. 

[[Users]] can only be a member of a single [[Organizational Unit]] at a time. It makes no sense to apply several policies to a single user.

[[Organizational Unit]]s cannot contain objects from other domains.

Example:

A company may have an [[Organizational Unit]] per department and apply specific [[Group Policy Objects]] for each one:

- Sales OU
- Marketing OU
- IT OU
- Management OU
