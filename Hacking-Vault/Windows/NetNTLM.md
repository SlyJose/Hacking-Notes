[[NetNTLM]] works using a challenge-response mechanism. 


##  üìó Authentication Process 

1. The client sends an authentication request to the server they want to access.
2. The server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client.
3. The client combines their NTLM password hash with the challenge (and other known data) to generate a response to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
4. The server forwards the challenge and the response to the [[Domain Controller]] for verification.
5. The [[Domain Controller]] uses the challenge to recalculate the response and compares it to the original response sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
6. The server forwards the authentication result to the client.

Note that the user's password (or hash) is never transmitted through the network for security.

Note: The described process applies when using a domain account. If a local account is used, the server can verify the response to the challenge itself without requiring interaction with the [[Domain Controller]] since it has the password hash stored locally on its SAM.

While [[NetNTLM]] should be considered obsolete, most networks will have both protocols enabled.

Services that use [[NetNTLM]] can also be exposed to the internet. Check [[NetNTLM Authenticated Services]]
