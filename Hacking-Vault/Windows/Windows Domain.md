A [[Windows Domain]] is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business.

Usual format: name.location
For example: ==mydomain.local==

Windows Workgroups, by contrast, is the other model for grouping computers running Windows in a networking environment which ships with Windows. Workgroup computers are considered to be 'standalone' - i.e. there is no formal membership or authentication process formed by the workgroup.
