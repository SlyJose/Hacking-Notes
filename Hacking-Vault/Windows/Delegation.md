Delegation allows a user or machine to act on behalf of another user to another service.  A common implementation of this is where a user authenticates to a front-end web application that serves a back-end database.  The front-end application needs to authenticate to the back-end database (using [[Kerberos]]) as the authenticated user.

Enabling unconstrained or constrained delegation on a computer requires the [SeEnableDelegationPrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/enable-computer-and-user-accounts-to-be-trusted-for-delegation) user right assignment on domain controllers, which is only granted to enterprise and domain admins.
