- Users: Either company employees or guests.
- Groups: two kinds depending on how you want to categorize your users
- Devices: you may have corporate devices (AAD joined), registered (bring your own device), hybrid (use on Azure AD creds as well as local system creds).
- Applications: this involves how Azure AD handles auth in applications

==App registration==: this includes all the configurations of the application
==Enterprise Application==: called **[[Service Principal]]**. You can use service principal outside Azure AD, for example in Terraform, to authenticate to Azure AD. You can attach it to any compute resources. 

Enterprise Apps can be:
- Microsoft App: owned by MS
- Custom App: created for you
- Managed Identity: app to attach to Azure compute resources.

All the access and permissions these objects have is handled by [[Entra ID Directory Role]]
