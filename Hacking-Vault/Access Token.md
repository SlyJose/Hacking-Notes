In Windows operating systems, an access token is a data structure that contains security information associated with a process or a thread, including the user's identity and privileges. 

Access tokens are used by the Windows security subsystem to control access to securable objects and to determine the actions that a user, or a process running on behalf of that user, is allowed to perform.
