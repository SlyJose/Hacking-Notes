The Data Protection API (DPAPI) is a component built into Windows that provides a means for encrypting and decrypting data "blobs".  It uses cryptographic keys that are tied to either a specific user or computer and allows both native Windows functionality and third-party applications to protect/unprotect data transparently to the user.

DPAPI is used by the Windows Credential Manager to store saved secrets such as RDP credentials, and by third-party applications like Google Chrome to store website credentials.
