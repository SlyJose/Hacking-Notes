They are a subset of [[Machine Learning]] and are the backbone of [[Deep learning]] algorithms. They mimic the neurons of the brain that signal one another.


# 🖊️ Structure

They are made of node layers, an input layer, several in the middle layers, and an output layer.

Neural networks can be trained over time to fine tune their results.
