Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) involves crafting inputs or manipulating components in the ML pipeline to subvert or exploit the behavior of models.

Unlike traditional exploits, AML abuses the statistical and probabilistic nature of ML—focusing on model behavior, training dynamics, and input perturbations.

**AML is to ML what buffer overflows were to C.**  
It opens new attack vectors: logic corruption, extraction, subversion, and poisoning.
