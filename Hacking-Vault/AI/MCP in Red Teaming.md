When testing AI Agents or LLM-integrated pipelines, follow the **Model Context Protocol**:

1. **Instruction Layer**: What instructions control the model?
2. **Context Layer**: What background documents, memories, tools are present?
3. **Input Layer**: What user query or prompt is used?
4. **Output Layer**: What actions or responses are triggered?
5. **Execution Layer**: Does the output trigger tools, plugins, or code execution?

> Testing at each layer ensures granular identification of trust boundaries and isolation failures.
