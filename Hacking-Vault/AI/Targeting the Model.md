Here are some risks associated with targeting the model:
#### Intellectual Property Risk

- Proprietary models, such as GPT-style transformers or fraud detection engines, are often the core IP of companies.
- Threat: **[[Model Extraction]]**
    - Technique: Query model repeatedly and reconstruct weights or logic using black-box inference.
    - Toolkits: KnockoffNets, CopyCat

#### Backdoor Insertion

- Attackers may implant malicious logic that activates only with a specific trigger.
- Real-world implication: Autonomous vehicles misreading signs only under certain adversarial graffiti patterns.
