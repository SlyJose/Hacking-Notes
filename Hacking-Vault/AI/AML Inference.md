**Membership Inference**:

- Attacker queries model and determines whether a given data point was part of training set.

**Model Inversion**:

- Reconstruct likely features of the training data from outputs.

**Example**: Rebuilding a facial image from a recognition model’s output logits using gradient approximation.

> This breaks privacy and can compromise biometric or sensitive training sets.
