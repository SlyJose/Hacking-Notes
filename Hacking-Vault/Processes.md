A _program_ is a set of instructions that have been compiled into a PE file, typically a `.exe` or `.dll`.  A _process_ can be thought of as a container to hold the resources of a running program.  

Multiple instances of the same program can be run, but they will do so in separate processes, and therefore have their own set of resources that are (mostly) isolated from each other.
