[[Cobalt Strike]] strategy to jump into another machine.

The `remote-exec` commands simply provide a means of executing commands on a remote target. ¬†They are therefore not exclusive to lateral movement, but they can be used as such. ¬†

They require more manual work to manage the payload, but do offer a wider degree of control over what gets executed on the target. ¬†You also need to connect to P2P Beacons manually using `connect` or `link`.

## üñäÔ∏è Usage

The syntax is `remote-exec [method] [target] [command]`

The available methods are:

```
beacon> remote-exec
