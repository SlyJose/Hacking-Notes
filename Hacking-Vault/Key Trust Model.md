Trust is established based on raw key data rather than a certificate (like [[Active Directory Certificate Services]]).

This requires a client to store their key on their own domain object, in an attribute called `msDS-KeyCredentialLink`.

The Key trust model is susceptible to the [[Shadow Credentials attack]]
