Subset of [[Artificial Intelligence]]  which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, improving it's accuracy.


 
# 🖊️ Types of Machine Learning


==Deep Machine Learning or Supervised Machine Learning== - uses labeled datasets to inform the algorithm and help it categorize the data. It can also use non-structured data and analyze its features. Related to [[Deep learning]]

==Classical or Non-Deep Machine Learning== - requires human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, requiring more structured data to learn. 

# 📔 How it works


1. Decision Process: The machine learning algorithm is used to make a prediction or classification. Based on input data (labeled or unlabeled) the algorithm produces and estimate.
2. Error Function: an error function evaluates the prediction of the model, compares it to known examples, assesses the accuracy of the model.
