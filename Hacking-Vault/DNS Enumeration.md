Using example domain "cyberbotic.io"
A Records lookup:

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;cyberbotic.io.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
cyberbotic.io.          0       IN      A       172.67.205.143
cyberbotic.io.          0       IN      A       104.21.90.222
```

Performing a `whois` on each public IP address can show who it belongs to. We can see that it resolves to a 3rd party provider, Cloudflare.

```
$ whois 172.67.205.143

OrgName:        Cloudflare, Inc.
OrgId:          CLOUD14
Address:        101 Townsend Street
RegDate:        2010-07-09
Updated:        2021-01-11

```

If the target is located in the cloud, you must obtain permissions to enumerate and attack these machines from both owner and the cloud provider.

Perform subdomain discoveries:

```
~/dnscan$ ./dnscan.py -d cyberbotic.io -w subdomains-100.txt

Weak email security (SPF, DMARC and DKIM) may allow us to spoof emails to appear as though they‚Äôre coming from their own domain. ¬†[Spoofy](https://github.com/MattKeeley/Spoofy) is a Python tool that can verify the email security of a given domain.

```
~/Spoofy$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~/Spoofy$ python3 spoofy.py -d cyberbotic.io -o stdout
