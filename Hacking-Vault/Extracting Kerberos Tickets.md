[[Kerberos]] tickets can help an attacker perform malicious actions.

#### Methods where you are extracting existing tickets

- [[Kerberoasting]] (extracts TGS)
- [[extract TGTs with Rubeus]] (extracts TGT)
- [[Local Delegation]] (extracts local TGT)
- [[Unconstrained Delegation]] (extracts TGT)
- [[Constrained Delegation]] (uses TGT to ask for TGS)

#### Methods where you are asking for a new ticket

- [[AS-REP Roasting]] (asks for TGT)
- [[Shadow Credentials attack]] (asks for a TGT)
- [[Misconfigured Certificate Templates]] (asks for TGT)
- [[ADCS Persistence]] (asks for TGT)

#### Methods where you are creating a new ticket

Check Domain Dominance in [[Breaching Active Directory]]

- [[Silver Tickets]] (creates a TGS)
- [[Golden Tickets]] (creates a TGT)
- [[Diamond Tickets]] (creates a custom TGT)
- [[Forged Certificates]] (creates a signed TGT)

### üñäÔ∏è via Pivoting

In this section is detailed how you can extract tickets with external tools via pivoting:

- [[Pivoting with Kerberos]]


### ‚ö† Rubeus + NTLM hash

If you have the NTLM or AES (can be extracted via [[dcsync]] or [[Impacket]] using getTGT, check [[Pivoting with Kerberos]]) hash of a user, you can request a new TGT for that user, using the technique [[Overpass the Hash]].
