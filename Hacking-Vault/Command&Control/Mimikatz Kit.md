Aggressor scripts loader for mimikatz versions. This kit will allow you to run newer versions of the tool in your beacon sessions.


#### 🚀 - Why using it?
---
Cobalt Strike uses an old version of mimikatz which does not run well with newer targets. Build the Mimikatz kit and reload to have the correct performance.

Example:

```
beacon> logonpasswords
ERROR kuhl_m_sekurlsa_acquireLSA ; Logon list
```
