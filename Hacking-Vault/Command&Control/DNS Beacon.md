This [[Cobalt Strike]] [[Beacon]] uses a [[DNS Listener]] to communicate.  

# 🖊️ Configs

Unlike the [[HTTP Beacon]], the [[DNS Beacon]] does not automatically send its metadata (owing to the lower data bandwidth of DNS), so it will appear in the UI as an "unknown" Beacon.

You must issue a manual `checkin` command before the metadata will appear.
