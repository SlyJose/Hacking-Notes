Listener for [[TCP Beacon]], this listener works as a bind shell, you create the payload and execute it in an existing beacon, this will put the Beacon in listen mode in the port you specified. 

To connect to it, from another beacon you run "connect" and it will link it. 

For example:

`beacon> connect localhost 4444`
