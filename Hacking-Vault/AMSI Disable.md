More information: [AMSI bypass](https://rastamouse.me/memory-patching-amsi-bypass/)

  `amsi_disable` only applies to `powerpick`, `execute-assembly` and `psinject`.  It **does not** apply to the powershell command.
  
#### 🖊️ via Cobalt Strike

Via the [[Malleable C2 Profile]], we can add a post-ex capability to disable amsi and execute binaries easier.

1) Go to your Malleable profile and right above the `http-get` block, add the following:

```
post-ex {
        set amsi_disable "true";
}
```

2) Check with C2lint the changes are correct.
3) Restart the teamserver and re-acquire beacon sessions into the victims.


#### ⚠ Opsec

Your beacon may still die even though your evading amsi, check Windows Behavioral section for more.
