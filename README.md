# Hacking-Notes

In order to maintain a healthy process of pentesting, a documented list of techniques and tactics is required. I have pilled up procedures that can be applied in Windows and Linux machines in order to analyze in depth their security posture.

Here techniques on Enumeration, Exploitation, Persistance, Lateral Movement and Active Directory can be found. I keep adding new techniques following along new machines I encounter and practice in hacking labs. 

Feel free to check it out and use these notes in a positive way to improve your knowledge and make the world a safer place !.
